# [⚠️WIP] pymongo-ORM
A copy-paste class for easily mapping and submitting non-built-in class attributes to your Mongo database. Specifically useful for ORM-based recovery systems. <br>
### Supports both **sync** and **async**!<br>
:warning: `The asynchronous class requires Motor (official async PyMongo driver)`
